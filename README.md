## Usage example
**1**. **Import framework**

        import SSCoachMarks
   
**2**. **Add the modifiers to start the coach mark sequence**
- To display a coach mark with default style, the following modifier needs to be added to the main parent view to initiate the coach mark sequence.
      
         // Main Parent View
        .modifier(CoachMarkView(onCoachMarkFinished: {
            // You can perform any action after completing your coach mark sequence
        }))

-   To display a coach mark with auto-transition, the following modifier needs to be added to the main parent view to initiate the coach mark sequence.
      
        // Main Parent View
        .modifier(CoachMarkView(isAutoTransition: true,
                                autoTransitionDuration: 3,
                                onCoachMarkFinished: {
            // You can perform any action after completing your coach mark sequence
        }))
    - `isAutoTransition`: The default value is false. However, if you want to perform the coach mark sequence with auto-transition, you need to set `isAutoTransition` to true. Additionally, you can specify the duration for automatic transitions between coach marks. The default value of `autoTransitionDuration` is 2 seconds. 

-   To display a coach mark with default style with customization buttons, the following modifier needs to be added to the main parent view to initiate the coach mark sequence.
    
        // Main Parent View
        .modifier(CoachMarkView(onCoachMarkFinished: {
            // You can perform any action after completing your coach mark sequence
        })
        .coachMarkTitleViewStyle(foregroundStyle: .blue, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold)
        .coachMarkDescriptionViewStyle(foregroundStyle: .pink, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold)
        .overlayStyle(overlayColor: .black, overlayOpacity: 0.5)
        .nextButtonStyle(foregroundStyle: .black, backgroundColor: .green, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold)
        .backButtonStyle(foregroundStyle: .black, backgroundColor: .green, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold)
        .doneButtonStyle(foregroundStyle: .black, backgroundColor: .green, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold)
        .skipCoachMarkButtonStyle(foregroundStyle: .black, backgroundColor: .green, fontSize: 14, fontWeight: .bold))

-   To display a coach mark with customization buttons, the following modifier needs to be added to the main parent view to initiate the coach mark sequence.
            
        @State var buttonEventsCoordinator = ButtonEventsCoordinator()
            
        // Main Parent View
        .modifier(CoachMarkView(buttonEventsCoordinator: buttonEventsCoordinator,
                                skipCoachMarkButton: // Here you can add your custom skip button,
                                nextButtonContent: // Here you can add your custom next button,
                                backButtonContent: // Here you can add your custom back button,
                                doneButtonContent: // Here you can add your custom done button,
                                onCoachMarkFinished: {
            // You can perform any action after completing your coach mark sequence
        }))

                      highlightViewCornerRadius: 5)

                    .resizable()
                    .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                    .foregroundColor(Color("customBackgroundColor"))
