    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - order: An `Int` representing the order in which the coach mark will appear relative to others.
    ///     This allows you to control the sequence of coach marks.
    ///   - title: An optional `String` for the title of the coach mark. If `nil`, no title will be displayed.
    ///   - description: A `String` providing the descriptive text of the coach mark. This is usually used to explain the highlighted feature.
    ///   - highlightViewCornerRadius: A `CGFloat` value that defines the corner radius of the view being highlighted.
    ///   - scaleEffect: A `CGFloat` value that determines the scaling effect of the highlighted view when the coach mark is shown. The default value is `1.2`.
    ///   - coachMarkBackGroundColor: A `Color` specifying the background color of the coach mark. The default color is white.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A view that contains the anchor preference with the associated `Highlight` object,
    ///            which will be used by the coach mark manager to display the coach mark in the correct sequence and style.
    ///
    /// - Example:
    ///   ```swift
    ///   someView.showCoachMark(order: 1,
    ///                          title: "This is a title",
